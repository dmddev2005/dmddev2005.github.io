      <h1>History of our Club </h1>
      <p class="lead">
BECC is a friendly club and we welcome new members to join us and participate in the development of the game of cricket in Japan. British residents have been playing cricket in Japan since it was first played in Yokohama in early Meiji. The Yokohama C&AC was created at that time and became the home for cricket in Japan. 
Cricket didn’t start to grow significantly until after WW2 and the Japan Cricket Association was formed in 1984, with more teams playing cricket. A British team was formed around this time mainly playing friendlies and taking part in the development of the game. BECC had fixtures both against other expat teams and University teams. 
In 2013, BECC entered the Japan Cup competition (T20 cricket) and the club now aims to play a mixture of T20 league cricket and friendlies, mainly playing at YC&AC in Yokohama.
